Package Name: day53_Iterator_Maps

Iterable(I): Root interface
        classes that implements iterable, gains the ability to iterate the objects
        we cna apply Iterator(I) to the classes that are implementing Iterable
        Iterator(I):
            1. it allows us to get access to each objects of the collections type
            2. it allows us to remove the objects from collection
            iterator(): iterates any given collection, then returns Iterator (I)
            hasNext(): check if there are enough elements that can be iterated. returns boolean
            next(): if  hasNext() is true, it accesses to the object and retrives it
            remove(): removes the current element of iteartion
