        OOP abstraction intro
package name: day46_final_abstract
final: constant, cannot be changed

        can only be applied to:
                1. variables: cannot be reassigned
                2. methods: implementation of the method can never be changed
                            final methods cannot be override, can be overload
                            constructors cannot be final
                3. class: immutable class, cannot be inherited
                            final class cannot be super class

abstraction: hiding the implementation details
        concentrating on essentials things, without worrying about the details
    Ex1:
        Car:
            start();
        BMW:
            start(): Push start button
        Toyota:
            start(): Insert key
    Ex2:
        shape:
            Area();
        Triangle:
            Area(): b * h * 1/2
        circle:
            Area(): r * r * PI
        Square:
            Area(): s * s
abstract method: a method without body/implementation
                 a method that's meant to be override
     public abstract void method();
