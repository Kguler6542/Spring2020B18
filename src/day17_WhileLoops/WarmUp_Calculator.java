						1. enter first number
						2. enter the second number
						3. enter the math operators
								(assume that only the +, -, *, /, and % will be entered)
						then the system will give the result based on the operator
						then the system will give the result based on the operator
						at the end it will ask if the user want's to calculate another numbers, if user
						entered "NO" or "no", the program will stop execution, otherwise it repeats all the previous steps
